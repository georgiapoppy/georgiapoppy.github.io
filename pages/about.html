            <h3>Hi! My name is Georgia Mason; I am 19 years old and a current third year student at the University of Adelaide.</h3>
            <p>I am an aspiring woman in STEM, and I'm currently studying a Bachelor of Computer Science (Advanced). I have a current GPA of 6.43, and graduated Nazareth Catholic College in 2022 with an ATAR of 97.00. (99.15 University Rank) Currently, I have a casual job as a retail assistant at Haigh's Chocolates, where I have been working for over a year. I also have many hobbies, including playing video games, crocheting, scrapbooking, listening to music, reading, and more.</p>

            <p>In 2023, I was also chosen as an ATSE Elevate: Boosting Diversity in STEM Scholar, which I am extremely grateful for. This scholarship aims to address gender inequality, while growing professional skills of women in STEM. I presented at an Elevate Information session, speaking about my experience with the Scholarship program.</p>

            <p>In 2021 I was also one of the 50 South Australian Year 12 students accepted for the National Youth Science Forum (NYSF). Throughout NYSF, I met other students who shared the same passion for STEM and gained incredible experience and insight into various STEM industries.</p>

            <p>Ever since I was in primary school, I have been very interested in technology. I love playing video games, analysing data in Excel, and coding robots and multiplication games in digital tech class was my favourite part of the school week. Being able to create my own games and programs has been a very enjoyable experience during high school and university. The process of creating a program from a small simple idea is my favourite part of computer science. Using logic, problem solving, planning and debugging strategies; the satisfaction of seeing a coding solution come to life inspires me to keep working towards my career. Whether I end up majoring in cyber security, data mining or using complex mathematical concepts to create algorithms, I am passionate to learn all that I can.</p>

            <p>I am also extremely passionate about inspiring fellow women to continue following their STEM interests. During high school, I was the only girl in my digital technologies class. I participated in the Women in STEM Careers Program in 2024, which builds the personal and professional skills of females studying STEM through workshops, panels and networking events. It would be my dream to be a great role model for future generations of women in STEM! :)</p>
